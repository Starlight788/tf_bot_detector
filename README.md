# How to use files
 Above are the custom ruleset I use for [Pazors Bot Detector](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector)
 Navigate to the Bot Detector folder and put both files in the **cfg** folder

 My ruleset will auto update (if I have made changes) every time Bot Detector is launched. The playerlist will not.

 I do not take responsablity if someone is falsely marked as a cheater.
